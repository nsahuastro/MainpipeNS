Descriptions of the northern countryside, a hot, dry scrub land, contrast wonderfully with the lush humidity of the regional capital of Recife and parallel the storylines of two sisters separated by unusual circumstances. Both girls raised and trained as seamstresses by their widowed aunt, are eventually drawn in completely different directions. The younger sister Luzia’s story of extreme physical hardship and love within a band of roaming outlaws really captured my imagination. I was fascinated reading about a group of people living outdoors, completely at the mercy of the elements and the violent struggles that accompany that choice. Eliza’s life in the city becomes dominated by politics inside and outside her home.\\nI really enjoyed this work of historical fiction, learning more about Brazil during the 1920’s and 30’s.

      "{'text': 'Patient engagement in the design and delivery of virtual health services is critical for success. Get inspired – in this panel session, you’ll learn about how three very different virtual care initiatives involved patients in their design, the lessons learned, and the results that followed.\\nFirst, Mathieu Jackson will present the importance for patients to\\u202flead self\\u202fand take responsibility for their own performance and health, through his own experience with virtual health as a hemophilia patient as well as his patient society’s (Canadian Hemophilia Society) involvement in the design and development of the Hemophilia management MyCBDR mobile application, used by close to 1,000 patients across Canada.\\nSecond, Dr. Laura Copeland will speak to the leader’s duty and privilege to\\u202fdevelop coalitions\\u202fby harnessing patient partnerships and networks to create results. She spearheaded the introduction of patient participation to physician documentation standards at Humber River Hospital to facilitate the evolution of patient portals with immediate availability of all results and documentation to patients. Now as a Chief Medical Information Officer at Healthtech, interacting with Canada-wide health technology systems, she flags building connections, trust and shared meaning with patients as an essential determinant to successful virtual health service delivery.\\nThird, Amy Pack will translate the importance of patient partnerships in the governance of virtual health service delivery. By shedding light on HSO’s people-powered approach to developing standards, she hopes to champion systems transformation by unleashing the potential of patient involvement in the assessment of the safety, quality, and efficacy of virtual health services around the world.\\nThrough these three topics and a panel discussion, attendees will gain insights on the undeniable value-add of involving patients in the conception and delivery of virtual health services, inspiring healthcare leaders from around the world to implement systematic change in the way they engage with patients.\\nVirtual Health has become an increasingly valuable and viable method of health service delivery, communication, information transfer, and education. It aims to support patient care and provide second opinions and consultation to individuals living in remote and isolated areas where access to healthcare is limited, as well as in urban settings. Removing the in-person interaction in the consultation creates a heightened duty for healthcare leaders to find innovative ways to involve patients in their virtual treatment plan. Effective partnerships with patients and families to accelerate patient safety, quality and health service planning in virtual health are being recognized as a best practice. As a result, new organizational initiatives, standards, policies, evidence and resources are being routinely developed across Canada and internationally. This panel will unravel the patient’s role in virtual health through the perspective of the patient, the provider and the health sciences specialist.', 'url': 'http://www.nhlc-cnls.ca/sessions/3/'}\n"

One way to then load an\\n  application context which is\\n  configured from all these XML\\n  fragments is to use the application\\n  context constructor which takes\\n  multiple Resource locations. With a\\n  bean factory, a bean definition reader\\n  can be used multiple times to read\\n  definitions from each file in turn.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Generally, the Spring team prefers the\\n  above approach, since it keeps\\n  container configuration files unaware\\n  of the fact that they are being\\n  combined with others. An alternate\\n  approach is to use one or more\\n  occurrences of the  element\\n  to load bean definitions from another\\n  file (or files).

As you can see, a\\n  leading slash is actually ignored, but\\n  given that these are considered\\n  relative paths, it is probably better\\n  form not to use the slash at all.

Her integrity will not allow her to seek an annulment as for her it was a real marriage.\\nA Zimbabwean man working in Johannesburg as a gardener tells me he cannot get back to see his children because there is not enough money to make the journey home. He sends money back for them each month but he hasn’t seen his wife and small children in over two years. He is a regular church-goer but has found little practical or emotional support in the parish community.\\nA lesbian woman in her early forties, who has a deep relationship with God, is adopting a little girl with her partner of five years. As a teenager she played an active role in the church, reading at Sunday mass and teaching catechetics. It is now too painful for her to attend mass as she does not feel welcome at the Eucharist with her family.\\nAs I listen again and again to good people, struggling to live their lives as best they can, often under very difficult circumstances, I want to be able to tell them that the Church is a place where they will find the support they need. I don’t want to have to try to reassure them that despite their often deeply painful experiences of church, they are nevertheless totally loved by God.\\nFamily life should be a place where the joy of love is experienced. However, often the pressures of life – or the tilted uncontrollable events and structures – make it difficult. For many people when their family life is in crisis the Church does not help. Sadly it sometimes makes the situation even more painful. People often either end up feeling perpetually on the fringes, burdened by guilt, or simply give up on both church and God.\\nWe need to ask ourselves whether the Church is a place where people experience encouragement and support or judgement and condemnation? Do we make it easier or harder for people to experience God’s love and acceptance?\\nFrancis has always appeared to be less interested in dogma and doctrine and more interested in helping people to encounter the God of love and mercy. His hands-on pastoral experience as a priest and as an Archbishop in Argentina confronted him daily with the reality of the burdens that people carry.\\nMy prayer is that Francis’s words in this Apostolic Exhortation may be words which lift burdens. I hope that they will perhaps soften hard-line church positions on issues such as communion for the divorced and remarried and the inclusion of gay and lesbian people so that they feel welcome.\\nI pray too that his words will recognise the challenges faced, among others, by newly married couples, refugees, single-parents, abused women and children. I hope that he encourages parishes to be places of welcome and support so that the Church may become the first place people turn to when they experience the inevitable challenges of family life.', 'url': 'http://www.jesuitinstitute.org.za/index.php/2016/04/06/amoris-laetitia/'}\n",

      "{'text': \"Amateur Radio Newsline Report Number 2050 with a release date of Friday, February 10, 2017 to follow in 5-4-3-2-1.\\nThe following is a QST. Hams test drive an experimental band in the U.S. Young amateurs prepare for School Club Roundup -- and we hear from the winner of the Dave Kalter Youth DX Adventure's essay competition. All this and more as Amateur Radio Newsline Report 2050 comes your way right now.\\nSTEPHEN/ANCHOR: We open this week's report with an update on a ham band that is still experimental -- at least in the U.S. Until 630 meters becomes mainstream in the States as it is so many places elsewhere in the world there are always events like the Mid-Winter 630-meter Operating Activity. Here's Amateur Radio Newsline's Skeeter Nash N5ASH with the details of the second such event, held earlier this month.\\nSKEETER: Conditions on 630 meters were average, according to Fritz Raab W1FR, coordinator of the ARRL'S 630 Meter Experimental group, but he told Amateur Radio Newsline that participants enjoyed the second annual mid-winter activity on the band.\\nAccording to a summary from John Langridge KB5NJD, WSPR activity was at an all-time high and there were abundant trans-Pacific openings. Canadian stations were eager participants as well on their newest band although hams in British Columbia had complications from snow and ice conditions. A number of stations were also active using CW and JT9.\\nRaab had said previously that as the solar cycle has gone into decline, MF propagation has improved, especially in the paths to VK and JA.\\nNow it is a matter of waiting. Countries permitting 630-meter band operation include Ireland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Finland, Canada, Poland and Bulgaria. Raab said hams in the U.S. have been hoping for the FCC to permit normal operation on 472 kHz to 479 kHz since 2004 and so they are accustomed to sitting things out. We hope their patience pays off.\\nFor Amateur Radio Newsline, I'm Skeeter Nash N5ASH.\\nANCHOR/STEPHEN: Meet Bryant Rascoll, KG5HVO, a young ham who just qualified for a DX adventure in Costa Rica with a winning essay about ham radio's meaning in his life. Let Amateur Radio Newsline's Don Wilbanks, AE5DW, introduce him to you.\\nDON: Last November YDXA, the Dave Kalter Youth DX Adventure announced an exciting essay competition for young radio amateurs between the ages of 12 and 18 describing their involvement in, personal future plans for, and importance of Amateur Radio. I am very pleased to introduce the winner, Bryant Rascoll, KG5HVO from my part of the world, New Orleans. Hi Bryant, welcome to Newsline!\\nBR - Hello Mr. Don, how are you?\\nDW - I'm well, thank you. How old are you Bryant?\\nBR - I'm 12 years old, about to be 13.\\nDW - When is your birthday?\\nBR - My birthday is on Saturday.\\nDW - Well, Happy Birthday! How long have you been a ham?\\nBR - One and a half years.\\nDW - What got you interested in ham radio?\\nDW - How did you hear about the YDXA essay contest?\\nDW - Tell me about how you found out that you had won the essay contest.\\nDW - Quite an exciting club meeting! Now besides the trip what else was included in the prize?\\nDW - And what license class are you?\\nDW - So you can use this right now! Did you already have an HF station?\\nDW - And when is the trip to Costa Rica?\\nBR - August 3rd through August 8th.\\nDW - Very exciting! Let's plug your local club. What club is that?\\nDON: A very impressive young radio amateur. I've said it many times... there are way more good apples in the basket than bad and if Bryant is any indication of the folks who are going to be running the world when we are done with it we will be in very good hands. Congratulations Bryant Rascoll, KG5HVO.\\nIf you would like to hear my extended conversation with Bryant just click on the Extra tab on the Newsline website.\\nFrom New Orleans, I'm Don Wilbanks, AE5DW.\\nSTEPHEN/ANCHOR: If you know anyone who's interested in the DX adventure in August, applications are still being accepted for team members. They will also be available at YDXAís HamventionÆ booth in May.\\nSTEPHEN/ANCHOR: Some other bright young hams will be on the air this month as part of Radio Scouting, as we hear from Amateur Radio Newsline's Bill Stearns, NE4RD.\\nBILL'S REPORT: This week in Radio Scouting we have one activation of the K2BSA call sign and two activations from Scout Camps on the Air.\\nJeffrey Kent, KB0GVI, is the control operator for the K2BSA portable 0 station at the Old Capitol Valley District Winter Camporee at Lake Iowa State Park in Landora, IA, on February 26.\\nChuck McBride, WS5ADV, is the control operator for WS5BSA at the Troop 20 Hut in Oklahoma City, OK, on February 11th. Charles will have the scouts active on 20 through 10 m on SSB from a Yaesu Ft-840 if the bands are open.\\nChuck will also be activating WS5BSA from the Chickasaw National Recreation Area on February 18th. This time they'll be active with a Yaesu FT-817 on 20m and 17m throughout the day. They will also be monitoring the SWIRA repeater system.\\nPista HA5AO is in Lesotho until February 26th as a volunteer at orphanages using the call sign 7P8EUDXF to celebrate 30 years of the European DX Foundation. He is on the air in his spare time. QSL cards go via OQRS to HA5AO.\\nYou can find Michael DF8AN on the air as CE0Y/DF8AN from Easter Isla nd until February 17th. Listen for him operating on CW and on Digital modes. He will move on to Juan Fernandez Island after February 21st and operate as CE0Z/DF8AN. QSLs go via his home call.\\nANCHOR/STEPHEN: The Ladies of the Net Radio Club KM6CIR have a big day scheduled aboard a historic World War II ship. Amateur Radio Newsline's Jim Damron, N8TMW has the details.\\nJIM: A lot of history has sailed aboard the USS Hornet Museum Ship which now makes Alameda, California its permanent home. The Naval aircraft carrier, formerly the USS Kearsage, was known in more recent decades for recovering the Apollo 11 astronauts following their return to Earth after the first moon landing mission in 1969.\\nOn Saturday, February 18th, the Ladies of the Net Radio Club KM6CIR will get closer to the ship's renowned history when they begin operating from the on-board radio station NB6GC beginning at 1900 UTC. The club, an informal net that meets weekday mornings on 40 meters, is based in Union City, California.\\nFor Amateur Radio Newsline, I'm Jim Damron, N8TMW.\\nANCHOR/STEPHEN: Of course, some hams would rather try for radio contact aboard a smaller boat, like a ferry, as we hear from Amateur Radio Newsline's Jason Daniels VK2LAW.\\nJASON: Ferry boats aren't exactly battleships but a few of the ones in Sydney Harbor are going to see some competetive action soon during the Sydney Amateur Radio Ferry contest on the 12th of March. The Waverley Amateur Radio Society VK2BV is hosting its second annual ferry contest, which is a VHF/UHF event utilizing both simplex frequencies and repeaters. The competition invites hams to contact other hams on hand-held receivers while on any of the ferries or wharves in and around Sydney Harbor.\\nThe event takes place from 10 am to 4 pm local time. There will be a number of honors including the coveted Worked All Ferries award. So if you're waiting for your ship - or perhaps your ferry - to come in, consider the purchase of an Opal Card for $2.50 which permits a full day's travel on board.\\nFor Amateur Radio Newsline, I'm Jason Daniels, VK2LAW.\\nANCHOR/STEPHEN: OK, hams, you have some homework to do as we hear from Amateur Radio Newsline's Neil Rapp WB9VPG.\\nNEIL: School Club Roundup is just around the corner once again. Itís time to support our school ham radio clubs by giving students a call on the air! The on-air activity, in a contest-like format, starts at 1300 UTC Monday, February 13th and lasts through 2359 UTC on Friday, February 17th. Lew Malchick, N2RQ, the eventís organizer from the sponsoring Long Island Mobile Amateur Radio Club, or LIMARC, explains the goal of School Club Roundup.\\nLEW: I constantly run into people who say we need new hamsÖ young hams. And, one of the ways to get them is to introduce them to ham radio. Get ëem on the air. And School Club Roundup is one of the ways to get them on the air. Schools of course are the biggest attraction, biggest multiplier in the scoring, and all of thatÖ but Itís not about the scoring, really. Itís just about the experience. You will hear elementary school age kids operating like theyíve been on the air for a decade. And youíll hear kids that have never touched a microphone or [worked] a digital contact before. But the whole idea is to give them the experience. And hopefully, sow the seeds of some new operators.\\nNEIL: In order for the kids to operate, they need some stations to contact.\\nLEW: If we depended only on the schools talking to other schools, it wouldnít be very much. You get on the air especially with the recent conditions, youíre not going to make that many contacts. So we need the individuals. We want everyone to get on and have some fun! And so, we have that opportunity. The other thing weíd like, since we've had some complaints in recent years, is for individual operators and maybe some net people and stuff like that, to be courteous. Recognize that a lot of these operators are very inexperienced. Give them a little slack, and be a little bit more courteous than you might otherwise be...or patient.\\nNEIL: For recommended frequencies and complete rules, visit www.arrl.org/school-club-roundup. And I look forward to hearing YOU on the air.\\nSTEPHEN: And finally, we close out this week's report with a special request from a good friend, Hap Holly KC9RP, who spoke with Amateur Radio Newsline's Paul Braun WD9GCO.\\nPAUL/ANCHOR: Most hams take the written word for granted. Whether itís an online article, something in QST or CQ, or perhaps a magazine article from a particular collectorís club on the history of a radio.\\nBut not everyone can do that. Take, for example, Hap Holly, KC9RP.\\nHap is not only the founder of The Radio Amateur Information Network, or RAIN Report broadcast, but a longtime contributor and supporter of Newsline as well. Heís also blind. For him, capturing and presenting amateur radio information and history in audio form is not only fun, itís critical. That is also the reason that he records every forum speaker at Dayton every year and presents them later in his broadcast.\\nHAP: I am concerned that, as time goes on, we are losing more and more of our radio ìpioneers.î After all, we just lost one of my mentors, Bill Pasternak, co-founder of Newsline, last year and every year it seems that there are more and more of those who were involved with ham radio manufacturers back in the Sixties and Seventies who are becoming Silent Keys. And I want to document ñ I want to archive ñ interviews with as many of these people as I can from manufacturers who are no longer around. I.E., Hammarlund, National, Heathkit, Lafayette, Allied, Gotham, Hallicrafters, you name it.\\nI have interviewed a few ñ Herb Johnson from Swan and Atlas ñ many back in the early 90s ñ Wes Schum of Central Electronics, heís gone, and it concerns me because I, as a blind person, do not have the access to some of this history. Oh, yeah, if you look around on the Internet enough maybe youíll find it, but I want to have it easily accessible in audio format so folks can play it in their own ham shack, put it on a net, play it in a radio club ñ that sort of thing. And thatís what the RAIN Report is for.\\nPAUL/ANCHOR: We here at Amateur Radio Newsline agree with Hap that itís important to document the history of our hobby, and we also feel that is best served by speaking directly with the people who were involved with that history.\\nHAP: The RAIN Report does update every week, usually on Saturday. And anyone can transmit it on amateur radio ñ you donít have to ask me for permission ñ and there is a break in the middle, of course because itís formatted to be transmitted by amateur radio.\\nPAUL: We appreciate all that Hap has done for Newsline over the years, and weíd like to help him, too.\\nNEWSCAST CLOSE: With thanks to Alan Labs; the ARRL; CQ Magazine; Dave Kalter Youth DX Adventure; Fritz Raab W1FR; Hap Holly and the RAIN Report; Irish Radio Transmitters Society; Ohio-Penn DX Bulletin; QRZ.COM; South African Radio League; Southgate Amateur Radio News; Ted Randall's QSO Radio Show; USS Hornet Amateur Radio Club; the Wireless Institute of Australia; WTWW Shortwave; the YL Beam Newsletter; and you our listeners, that's all from the Amateur Radio Newsline.
