Descriptions of the northern countryside, a hot, dry scrub land, contrast wonderfully with the lush humidity of the regional capital of Recife and parallel the storylines of two sisters separated by unusual circumstances. Both girls raised and trained as seamstresses by their widowed aunt, are eventually drawn in completely different directions. The younger sister Luzia’s story of extreme physical hardship and love within a band of roaming outlaws really captured my imagination. I was fascinated reading about a group of people living outdoors, completely at the mercy of the elements and the violent struggles that accompany that choice.

      "{'text': 'Patient engagement in the design and delivery of virtual health services is critical for success. Get inspired – in this panel session, you’ll learn about how three very different virtual care initiatives involved patients in their design, the lessons learned, and the results that followed.\\nFirst, Mathieu Jackson will present the importance for patients to\\u202flead self\\u202fand take responsibility for their own performance and health, through his own experience with virtual health as a hemophilia patient as well as his patient society’s (Canadian Hemophilia Society) involvement in the design and development of the Hemophilia management MyCBDR mobile application, used by close to 1,000 patients across Canada.\\nSecond, Dr. Laura Copeland will speak to the leader’s duty and privilege to\\u202fdevelop coalitions\\u202fby harnessing patient partnerships and networks to create results. She spearheaded the introduction of patient participation to physician documentation standards at Humber River Hospital to facilitate the evolution of patient portals with immediate availability of all results and documentation to patients. Now as a Chief Medical Information Officer at Healthtech, interacting with Canada-wide health technology systems, she flags building connections, trust and shared meaning with patients as an essential determinant to successful virtual health service delivery.\\nThird, Amy Pack will translate the importance of patient partnerships in the governance of virtual health service delivery. By shedding light on HSO’s people-powered approach to developing standards, she hopes to champion systems transformation by unleashing the potential of patient involvement in the assessment of the safety, quality, and efficacy of virtual health services around the world.\\nThrough these three topics and a panel discussion, attendees will gain insights on the undeniable value-add of involving patients in the conception and delivery of virtual health services, inspiring healthcare leaders from around the world to implement systematic change in the way they engage with patients.\\nVirtual Health has become an increasingly valuable and viable method of health service delivery, communication, information transfer, and education. It aims to support patient care and provide second opinions and consultation to individuals living in remote and isolated areas where access to healthcare is limited, as well as in urban settings. Removing the in-person interaction in the consultation creates a heightened duty for healthcare leaders to find innovative ways to involve patients in their virtual treatment plan. Effective partnerships with patients and families to accelerate patient safety, quality and health service planning in virtual health are being recognized as a best practice. As a result, new organizational initiatives, standards, policies, evidence and resources are being routinely developed across Canada and internationally. This panel will unravel the patient’s role in virtual health through the perspective of the patient, the provider and the health sciences specialist.', 'url': 'http://www.nhlc-cnls.ca/sessions/3/'}\n"

      "{'text': \"The model, started with the support of in\\xadternational cooperation, is proposed by Peru as a paradigm to be followed world\\xadwide by regions and countries that also deal with problems associated with crops grown for illicit purposes.\\nThe goal of the ICAD conference in Lima was to reach a consensus on 'Guiding Prin\\xadciples', based on a draft prepared at the first ICAD meeting in Thailand in November 2011. The principles should facilitate the implementation of effective Alternative De\\xadvelopment programs, assessed in two ways: economic development of regions where il\\xadlicit crops are grown, and the reduction of these crops. The document will be pre\\xadsented for approval at the fifty-sixth session of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) to be held in March 2013. It is seen as the culmination of a long process that can be traced back to the debate that began at the UN General As\\xadsembly Special Ses\\xadsion (UNGASS) on Drugs in 1998.\\nThe supposed world consensus on princi\\xadples to guide Alternative Development pro\\xadjects appear to be far removed from the reality of the Upper Huallaga Valley, the very zone were Peru's supposedly exem\\xadplary model for Alternative Development is being implemented. This briefing exposes the breach between rhetoric and reality by examining the impact of AD projects in Peru, focussing on its impact on peasant families.\\nThe experience of Upper Huallaga shows, like many other AD projects, severe limita\\xadtions in these programmes' goals of reduc\\xading coca-production and achieving the broader aims of sustainable development. They reach relatively few farmers, with “beneficiaries” accounting for less than one quarter of the farmers in the region. They promote monocrop cultivation in a bio\\xadlogical diverse area, resulting in severe environmental impacts. Their success relies on large-scale production for export in an area that is not apt for this kind of farming due to its ecological fragility and soil qual\\xadity. Finally the programmes are unsustain\\xadable over time because they depend on international demand and prices of the products it promotes: cacao, coffee, palm heart, palm oil and sugar cane.\\nThe key question that the international community should ask when the document is discussed during the CND in March 2013 in Vienna is if these Guiding Principles will help break the failed logic applied until now, which has prioritised forced eradica\\xadtion and added development as an after\\xadthought. In addition, given that this is an issue that goes to the heart of rural devel\\xadopment, it is essential to identify the stake\\xadholders these projects are geared to and to define if the development model promoted is appropriate to meet the stated goal.\\nThe Guiding Principles for Alternative Development should break with the ap\\xadplied logic in which forced eradication is the principal objective and development considered a detail.\\nAccording to the Alternative Develop\\xadment project participants in the Upper Huallaga, national and international agen\\xadcies only measure “success” by the reduc\\xadtion of coca crops and do not take into ac\\xadcount the opinion of residents.\\nSuccessive Peruvian governments have wasted opportunities to increase a more positive state presence in coca-growing regions due to the application of forced eradication operations and failure to im\\xadple\\xadment sustainable development projects.\\nFor Alternative Development projects to work, it remains fundamentally im\\xadportant to understand how illegal activities are em\\xadbedded in the local context and why they continue to be impenetrable to efforts to combat them.\", 'url': 'https://www.tni.org/en/briefing/between-reality-and-abstraction'}\n",

      "{'text': 'High school coaches see recruiting shift after early signing\\n\\nAll the top 2018 football prospects at St. Peter\\'s Prep in New Jersey took advantage of the new NCAA signing period and wrapped up their recruitments in December.\\nStill, St. Peter\\'s coach Rich Hansen has been kept busy lately by college recruiters.\\n\"Duke just left. Syracuse was in this morning. Northwestern\\'s in tomorrow. Virginia,\" Hansen said recently.\\nThe day before, Rutgers coach Chris Ash and coaches from Penn State swung by the Jersey City school that has produced Alabama All-American Minkah Fitzpatrick and Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush in recent years. The previous week, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer dropped by.\\n\"It\\'s the same traffic. It\\'s the same schedule,\" Hansen said. \"The agenda just changed a little bit. But they\\'re not going to give up an open (recruiting) period.\"\\nThe first two-legged signing period in major college football began Dec. 20 and will largely wrap up on Feb. 7, the traditional first Wednesday of February. The modified agenda for schools this January has been to fill a handful of open spots in the 2018 class and get a running start on 2019 and beyond.\\nSeveral longtime, successful high school coaches gave the new recruiting calendar generally positive reviews. They were hopeful early signing would create more clarity and opportunities for their players. They said they have seen an increase in the recruitment of their remaining prospects. And while adding signing-day planning to the to-do list during playoff time was not ideal, none of the four thought it distracted players to the detriment of the team.\\nAccording to recruiting and scouting analyst Tom Luginbill of ESPN, about 2,800 prospects sign in a typical year. During the Dec. 20-22 signing period, 2,003 high school players signed with Bowl Subdivision schools. Another 360 prospects are unsigned but committed heading into next week\\'s traditional signing day, Luginbill said.\\nHansen had six players sign in December, including three of the top 20 prospects in New Jersey, according to 247 Sports\\' composite rankings.\\n\"It\\'s over and done and I can start getting the kids going to D-IIs and IIIs, and the juniors and sophomores and freshmen,\" Hansen said. \"But if I\\'m on the other side of the table and I\\'m waiting for that offer and it hasn\\'t come, I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to feel about it.\"\\nHansen said having most of the top prospects signed should help clear the \"logjam\" of prospects farther down the board that in past years would be holding out for better offers. With 10 days remaining before signing day, only 18 of 247 Sports\\' top 100 prospects were uncommitted. Another 13 were verbally committed, but unsigned.\\nSteve Mask, head coach at St. Paul\\'s Episcopal in Mobile, Alabama, had his best player, cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis, sign with the Crimson Tide in December. Mask\\'s quarterback, Swift Lyle, held out, hoping that a Power Five offer might come. That\\'s happened, Mask said. It\\'s impossible to know if that would have happened without the early signing period, but it seems like a positive sign to Mask.\\n\"It may benefit those kids to some degree,\" Mask said. \"The other side of that coin is it could also backfire. If Timbuktu College is a Group of Five and they\\'re recruiting three quarterbacks and they say, \\'You know what? We\\'re going to take the first one that signs in December.\\' All of sudden that kid that gambled a little bit may not have the opportunity to come back.\"\\nWith college recruiters no longer having to focus on verbally committed recruits through January, guarding against last-minute flips, they have more time to take a swing at a top uncommitted recruit such as linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu from Southern California powerhouse Mater Dei.\\n\"That many more phone calls started to happen. That many more tweets. I guarantee these guys are coming in and (asking), \\'What do you know about Solomon?\\'\" Mater Dei coach Bruce Rollinson said.\\nRollinson\\'s team won the state championship in 2017 in a game played four days before the early signing period opened. He said he never felt as if the looming decision-day affected his players.\\nKevin Wright, head coach at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, a school that draws elite athletes of all kinds from all over the world, had 19 players sign with FBS schools in December. It didn\\'t necessarily hurt his team, he said, but he could tell recruiters were anxious to have players signed in December.\\n\"It definitely weighs on those kids,\" Wright said. \"They\\'re getting pushed hard right in the middle of the season to commit.\"\\nRollinson said the only nuisance caused by the early signing period was trying to prepare a signing day celebration for players inking a national letter of intent in December. He said the event lost some of its luster.\\n\"Whereas in February, we as a school try to make it as special, as we have done in the past,\" he said.\\nMask said less attention on signing day was fine by him.\\n\"Most people were out for the holidays. You didn\\'t have all that fanfare,\" Mask said. \"You didn\\'t have ESPN using 19 channels to try to cover everybody from all over the country. And from that standpoint I thought that was a major benefit.\"\\n___\\nFollow Ralph D.

Las manos y los pies sudorosos son una respuesta normal a la ansiedad y también es habitual que una persona sude mucho cuando tiene fiebre. Sin embargo, una sudación frecuente y abundante en todo el cuerpo requiere atención médica porque puede ser un signo de hiperactividad del tiroides, una baja concentración de glucosa en la sangre o una alteración en la región del sistema nervioso que controla la sudoración. Las personas que padecen esta enfermedad producen sudor en cantidades mucho más grandes de las necesarias para controlar su temperatura corporal.\\nSe trata de una patología que afecta por igual a hombres y a mujeres; por lo general, comienza a manifestarse en la infancia y la adolescencia. Factores de tipo emocional como el estrés, la tensión y la ansiedad pueden incrementar la actividad de las glándulas sudoríparas y, por lo tanto, agravar la hiperhidrosis. Los síntomas de la sudoración excesiva son fácilmente perceptibles, por lo que no es necesaria la realización de pruebas específicas para llegar al diagnóstico. Sin embargo, los análisis de sangre pueden detectar si la función tiroidea o los niveles de glucosa en sangre son anormales y determinar así los casos en los que la hiperhidrosis esté provocada por hiperactividad del tiroides o una baja concentración de glucosa en sangre.', 'url': 'https://www.clinicaericlicea.com/reduccion-de-la-sudoracion-corporal/'}\n",
